# acadia-carriage-roads-map

A map that displays information about the carriage roads in Acadia National
Park. **The map is not to scale**. Trying to navigate based on just the signs at
intersections is notoriously difficult this map makes it easier to get from
place to place in the park. Helpful information includes:

- Each intersection is numbered and indicates the sign name directions.
- Includes park landmarks like: Hulls Cove Visitor Center, Jordan Pond
  House, Eagle Lake Carriage Road Entry, Hadlock Pond Carriage Road Entry
- Distances between intersections is indicated on each road segment.

You can use the [Island Explorer buses](https://islandexplorermap.com/) to get
around the island with or without your bike. For maps and detailed information
about each route, stop, point of interest and **updated bus locations** on a
map of the island visit [islandexplorer.app](https://www.islandexplorer.app/).

The maps have been designed with the following in mind:

- The relationships of roads at intersections is accurate. For example if one
  road enters from the west and another from west northwest they will be shown
  with an acute angle between them.
- Minimize the distractions that are caused by maps with roads that are
  overlayed on a geographically accurate depiction where roads have turns and
  switchbacks and important navigation details may be obscured.
- Intersection locations on the map are geographically relative; latitude and
  longitude relationships of intersections are accurate.
