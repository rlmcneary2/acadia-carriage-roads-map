# acadia-carriage-roads-map

A map that displays information about the carriage roads in Acadia National
Park. The maps have been designed with the following in mind:

- Understanding of carriage road intersection numbers, intersecting road names,
  and destinations. Trying to navigate based on just the signs at intersections
  is notoriously difficult.
- The relationships of roads at intersections is accurate. For example if one
  road enters from the west and another from west northwest they will be shown
  with an acute angle between them.
- Minimize the distractions that are caused by maps with roads that are
  overlayed on a geographically accurate depiction where roads have turns and
  switchbacks and important navigation details may be obscured.
- Intersection locations on the map are geographically relative; latitude and
  longitude relationships of intersections are accurate.
